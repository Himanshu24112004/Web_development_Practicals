                    Difference Between <ol> and <ul> Tags
The primary distinction between the <ol> and <ul> tags in HTML is how they structure lists and how those lists are displayed:

<ol> (Ordered List) Tag

Represents a list of items with a specific order or sequence.

List items are automatically numbered by the browser.

Used when the order of the items matters (e.g., instructions, rankings, steps in a process).

Each item within the list is defined using the <li> (list item) tag.

<ul> (Unordered List) Tag

Represents a list of items without any specific order.

List items are usually displayed with bullet points.

Used when the order of items does not matter (e.g., features, shopping lists, ingredients).

Each item within the list is also defined using the <li> tag.

Basic HTML Structure
Ordered List (<ol>)
<ol>
  <li>First step</li>
  <li>Second step</li>
  <li>Third step</li>
</ol>
The above code will render a numbered list.

Unordered List (<ul>)
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
This will display a bullet-point list (by default).
