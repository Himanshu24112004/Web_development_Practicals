                    Purpose of the <a> Tag in HTML
    The <a> tag (anchor tag) in HTML is used to create hyperlinks that allow users to navigate between web pages, jump to specific sections within a page, link to external resources, or trigger actions like opening email clients. 
    It is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web, enabling the interconnected structure of hypertext documents.
    The <a> tag by itself is just a placeholder; it becomes functional when paired with attributes, most importantly the href (hypertext reference) attribute, which specifies the link destination.​

Syntax for Creating a Hyperlink
The basic syntax for creating a hyperlink using the <a> tag is:

<!--<a href="URL" target="_blank" title="Link Title">Anchor Text</a>--->
Explanation of Each Part
1. <a> - Opening Tag
This marks the beginning of the anchor element. It tells the browser that a hyperlink is being defined.​

2. href="URL" - Hypertext Reference Attribute
The most important attribute of the <a> tag​
Specifies the destination of the link—where the user will be directed when they click​

The URL can be:
Absolute URL: Full web address including domain (e.g., href="https://www.example.com")
Relative URL: Path to a page within the same website (e.g., href="/about.html")
Anchor link: Link to a specific section on the same page using an ID (e.g., href="#contact")
Email address: Opens email client (e.g., href="mailto:example@email.com")
Phone number: Initiates a call (e.g., href="tel:+910000000")​

3. target="_blank" - Target Attribute (Optional)
Specifies where to open the linked document. Common values include:​

_blank: Opens the link in a new window or tab​
_self: Opens in the same window/tab (default behavior)​
_parent: Opens in the parent frame​
_top: Opens in the full body of the window​

4. title="Link Title" - Title Attribute (Optional)
Provides additional information about the link that appears as a tooltip when users hover over it. 
This can improve user experience and accessibility, though it should be used carefully.​

5. Anchor Text
The visible, clickable text between the opening and closing tags. 
This is what users see and click on.
 Search engines like Google use anchor text to understand the content and context of the linked page.​

6. </a> - Closing Tag
Marks the end of the anchor element.
