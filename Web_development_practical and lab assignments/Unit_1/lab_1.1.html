                Attributes in HTML tags are used to provide additional information about an element, control its behavior, or define its appearance on a webpage.<br> 
                Attributes are specified in the opening tag and usually come in name-value pairs, such as name="value".​

                Commonly Used HTML Attributes

                1. href (Hyperlink Reference)
                The href attribute is used with the <a> (anchor) tag to define the destination URL of a link.​
                Example:
                 href="https://www.example.com" 
                This will create a hyperlink that, when clicked, takes the user to "https://www.example.com".[9]

                2. src (Source)
                The src attribute is used with the <img> tag (and other media tags like <video>, <audio>) to specify the location (path) of the image or media file to be displayed.
                Example:
                 src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo"
                This displays the image located at "logo.png".​
